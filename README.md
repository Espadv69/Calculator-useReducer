# Calculator with React and Vite using useReducer

This project is a basic calculator built with React and Vite. The state management logic is implemented using the `useReducer` hook.

## Key Features

- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Reset functionality.
- Dynamic handling of entered digits.
- Clear display of the current value.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building components.
- **Vite**: For a modern and fast development environment.
- **useReducer**: For predictable state management of the calculator.
